# RayGen Insight - Regenerative Intelligence Platform
Live URL: https://regeninsight-9takto.manus.space
## 🏆 Project Overview

*RayGen Insight* is an AI-powered, blockchain-verified environmental intelligence platform designed to monitor, restore, and sustain Kenya’s natural ecosystems.  
By integrating real-time satellite data, AI analysis, and community participation, RayGen Insight helps stakeholders across Kenya’s 47 counties make informed decisions for land restoration, water conservation, and carbon credit verification.

## 🌍 The Problem

Kenya faces increasing challenges of **land degradation**, **deforestation**, and **water scarcity**, directly affecting livelihoods, biodiversity, and climate resilience.  
Current gaps include:

- *Lack of real-time environmental monitoring tools*
- *Limited access to actionable sustainability insights*
- *Fragmented data between government, NGOs, and communities*
- *Carbon verification processes lacking transparency and trust*

---

## 💡 Our Solution

RayGen Insight provides a unified platform that combines **AI, satellite data, and blockchain** to deliver transparent, data-driven insights through four core modules:

### 1. 🛰 Geo-Intelligence Dashboard
- Real-time environmental data for all **47 Kenyan counties**
- Interactive visualizations for **NDVI, rainfall, water stress, and carbon potential**
- Dynamic county selection with detailed analytics

### 2. 🌾 AI-Powered Regeneration Insights
- AI recommendations for optimal **tree species** per soil and rainfall type  
- Predictive analysis for **carbon sequestration potential**  
- Early-warning system for **high-risk degradation zones**

### 3. 📸 Community Engagement & Media Uploads
- Citizens can upload **images of restoration efforts**
- AI categorizes and tags submissions by **county and ecosystem type**
- Promotes local participation in environmental stewardship

### 4. ⛓ Blockchain-Verified Carbon Ledger
- Immutable record of carbon data using **Polygon Blockchain**
- Transparent tracking of verified carbon credits
- Promotes integrity and accountability in sustainability efforts
